---

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up XBot on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the XBot repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xbot.git
cd xbot
```

*Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username or the repository's URL.*

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies without affecting your global Python installation.

#### Using `venv` (Built-in)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

#### Using `virtualenv` (Alternative)

If you prefer `virtualenv`, first install it:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment to ensure that all dependencies are installed within it.

#### On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

*Once activated, your terminal prompt should prefix with `(venv)` indicating that the virtual environment is active.*

### 4. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment active, install all required Python packages using `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs all listed packages.*

---

## Configuration

Proper configuration is crucial for XBot to function correctly. This involves setting up environment variables and defining the character profile.

### Environment Variables

XBot uses environment variables to manage sensitive information and configurable settings. These variables are defined in a `.env` file.

#### 1. Create a `.env` File

In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env`.

```bash
touch .env
```

#### 2. Populate the `.env` File

Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following variables:

```env
# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Twitter API Credentials
TWITTER_API_KEY=your_twitter_api_key
TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY=your_twitter_api_secret_key
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_twitter_access_token
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_twitter_access_token_secret

# Character Configuration Path
CHARACTER_CONFIG_PATH=config/xbot_character.json

# Database Path (optional, defaults to 'my_lancedb')
DB_PATH=my_lancedb

# Embedding Model (optional, defaults to 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
EMBEDDING_MODEL=sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

# Language Model (optional, defaults to 'gpt-4')
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4
```

*Replace the placeholder values (`your_openai_api_key`, etc.) with your actual credentials.*

**Important:** Ensure that the `.env` file is **never** committed to version control. The provided `.gitignore` already excludes it, but double-check to maintain security.

### Character Profile

The character profile defines the persona, behavior, and interaction style of XBot. It's defined in a JSON file located at `config/xbot_character.json`.

#### 1. Locate the Character Profile

The default character profile file is located at:

```
xbot/config/xbot_character.json
```

#### 2. Customize the Character Profile

Open the `xbot_character.json` file in a text editor to customize XBot's persona. Below is a sample structure with explanations for each section.

---

## Data Ingestion

Data ingestion is the process of fetching, processing, and storing data from specified URLs into the database. This data forms the knowledge base that XBot uses to generate informed responses.

### Steps to Ingest Data

1. **Ensure Configuration is Set:**
   - Verify that the `ingestion_urls` in `config/xbot_character.json` are correct and accessible.

2. **Run the Data Ingestion Script:**

   The `data_ingestion.py` script uses the `XBot` class to ingest data. This ensures consistency and avoids code duplication.

   ```bash
   python data/data_ingestion.py --config_path=config/xbot_character.json --table_name=xbot_data
   ```

   **Parameters:**

   - `--config_path`: Path to the character configuration JSON file. Defaults to `config/xbot_character.json`.
   - `--table_name`: Name of the database table to use. Defaults to `xbot_data`.

3. **Monitoring the Process:**

   - The script will log the progress of data ingestion. Look for messages indicating successful loading, splitting, and insertion of data.
   - If any errors occur, they will be logged for troubleshooting.

4. **Verifying Data Ingestion:**

   - After successful execution, the specified database table (`xbot_data`) should contain the ingested data.
   - You can explore the database using LanceDB tools or any compatible database viewer to verify the entries.

### Tips

- **Data Sources:** Ensure that the URLs provided are reliable and contain relevant information to maintain the quality of XBot's responses.
- **Frequency of Ingestion:** Depending on the frequency at which the data sources update, schedule regular ingestion to keep the knowledge base current.
- **Handling Large Data:** For large datasets, consider batching the ingestion process or optimizing embedding generation to enhance performance.

---

## Running the Bot

Once data ingestion is complete, you can start the XBot to begin interacting on Twitter.

### Steps to Run XBot

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   Ensure that your virtual environment is active. If not, activate it using:

   - **On macOS and Linux:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - **On Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

2. **Run the Bot Script:**

   Execute the `run_xbot.py` script to start the bot.

   ```bash
   python bots/run_xbot.py --config_path=config/xbot_character.json --table_name=xbot_data
   ```

   **Parameters:**

   - `--config_path`: Path to the character configuration JSON file. Defaults to `config/xbot_character.json`.
   - `--table_name`: Name of the database table to use. Defaults to `xbot_data`.

3. **Understanding the Process:**

   - **Initialization:** The bot initializes logging, loads the character configuration, connects to the database, and sets up necessary utilities.
   - **Data Ingestion:** Although data ingestion is typically done separately, ensure that data is up-to-date before running the bot.
   - **Processing Queries:** The bot can process user queries, generate responses using the GPT-4 model, and interact on Twitter by posting tweets or sending DMs.
   - **Logging:** Monitor the terminal for logs indicating the bot's activities, responses, and any potential errors.

4. **Example Interaction:**

   Upon running, the bot executes an example interaction as defined in `run_xbot.py`:

   ```python
   user_query = "Can you explain the basics of Quantum Computing?"
   response = bot.process_query(user_query)
   print(f"Bot Response: {response}")
   ```

   You should see the bot's response printed in the terminal and potentially posted on Twitter, depending on your configuration.

### Automating Bot Execution

For continuous operation, consider running the bot as a background service or using process managers like **Supervisor**, **systemd**, or **PM2**. This ensures that the bot remains active and restarts in case of failures.

---

## Testing

Testing is essential to ensure that XBot functions as expected and to prevent regressions during development.

### Running Unit Tests

XBot includes a suite of unit tests located in the `tests/` directory. These tests verify the core functionalities of the bot.

#### 1. Navigate to the Project Root

Ensure you're in the root directory of the project.

```bash
cd xbot
```

#### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

If not already active, activate your virtual environment:

- **On macOS and Linux:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **On Windows:**

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

#### 3. Run the Tests

Execute the following command to run all tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

**Explanation:**

- `python -m unittest discover tests`: This command discovers and runs all test cases in the `tests/` directory.

#### 4. Analyzing Test Results

- **Success:** If all tests pass, you'll see output indicating success.
- **Failures or Errors:** If any tests fail or encounter errors, the output will detail the issues for debugging.

### Writing Additional Tests

To ensure comprehensive coverage, consider writing additional tests for:

- **Data Ingestion:** Verify that data is correctly fetched, processed, and stored.
- **Response Generation:** Ensure that responses are generated as per the configuration.
- **Twitter Interactions:** Mock Twitter API interactions to test tweeting and DM functionalities without making actual API calls.
- **Error Handling:** Test how the bot handles various error scenarios, such as API failures or invalid inputs.

**Example Test Case:**

```python
# tests/test_xbot.py

import unittest
from bots.xbot import XBot

class TestXBot(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.bot = XBot(config_path='config/xbot_character.json', table_name='test_xbot_data')

    def test_ingest_data(self):
        try:
            self.bot.ingest_data()
            # Further assertions can be added based on database content
            self.assertTrue(True)  # Placeholder
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"Ingest data failed with exception: {e}")

    def test_process_query(self):
        try:
            response = self.bot.process_query("What is Machine Learning?")
            self.assertIsInstance(response, str)
            self.assertTrue(len(response) > 0)
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"Process query failed with exception: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

**Note:** For more robust testing, use mocking libraries like `unittest.mock` to simulate external API interactions.

---

## Logging

Proper logging is vital for monitoring the bot's activities, debugging issues, and maintaining overall health.

### Logging Configuration

Logging is centralized using the `setup_logging` function defined in `utils/logger_config.py`. By default, logs are output to the console, but you can also configure file logging.

#### Default Logging Setup

```python
# utils/logger_config.py

import logging
from typing import Optional

def setup_logging(level: int = logging.INFO, log_file: Optional[str] = None) -> None:
    """
    Set up logging configuration.

    :param level: Logging level.
    :param log_file: Optional path to a log file.
    """
    handlers = [
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
    if log_file:
        handlers.append(logging.FileHandler(log_file))

    logging.basicConfig(
        level=level,
        format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
        handlers=handlers
    )
```

### Customizing Logging

1. **Enable File Logging:**

   To persist logs to a file, modify the `setup_logging` call in your scripts by specifying the `log_file` parameter.

   ```python
   # bots/run_xbot.py

   from utils.logger_config import setup_logging

   def main(config_path: str, table_name: str):
       try:
           setup_logging(log_file='logs/xbot.log')
           # Rest of the code...
       except Exception as e:
           logging.error(f"An error occurred in main: {e}")
   ```

2. **Adjust Logging Level:**

   Change the verbosity of logs by setting the `level` parameter.

   - **Levels:**
     - `logging.DEBUG`: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
     - `logging.INFO`: Confirmation that things are working as expected.
     - `logging.WARNING`: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem.
     - `logging.ERROR`: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
     - `logging.CRITICAL`: A very serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

   **Example:**

   ```python
   setup_logging(level=logging.DEBUG)
   ```

### Accessing Logs

- **Console Logs:** Displayed directly in the terminal where the bot is running.
- **File Logs:** Stored in the specified log file (e.g., `logs/xbot.log`). Ensure that the directory exists or implement directory creation logic.

**Tip:** Regularly monitor log files to identify and address issues promptly.

### 1. **Customizing LLM Settings**

Adjust the behavior of the GPT-4 model by modifying the `llm_settings` in the character profile.

```json
"llm_settings": {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_tokens": 150,
    "top_p": 0.9,
    "frequency_penalty": 0.0,
    "presence_penalty": 0.6,
    "stop_sequences": ["\n", " User:", " Alexandra:"],
    "knowledge_cutoff": "2023-10",
    "fallback_responses": [
        "I'm sorry, but I couldn't process your request at the moment.",
        "Apologies, I'm having trouble understanding that. Could you please rephrase?",
        "I'm here to help! Let's try a different question."
    ]
}
```

- **Temperature:** Controls the randomness of responses. Lower values make output more deterministic.
- **Max Tokens:** Limits the length of responses. Adjust based on desired verbosity.
- **Top_p:** Controls the diversity of the output. Lower values make the output more focused.
- **Frequency Penalty:** Reduces the likelihood of repeated phrases.
- **Presence Penalty:** Increases the likelihood of introducing new topics.
- **Stop Sequences:** Defines sequences where the model should stop generating further tokens.
- **Knowledge Cutoff:** Specifies the date up to which the model has knowledge.

### 2. **Adjusting Rate Limits**

Modify the rate limiting settings to control how frequently XBot interacts on Twitter.

```json
"interaction_policies": {
    "rate_limit_per_minute": 60,
    "error_handling_strategy": "retry_with_exponential_backoff",
    "logging_level": "INFO"
}
```

- **rate_limit_per_minute:** Sets the maximum number of interactions per minute. Adjust based on Twitter's API rate limits and your bot's activity needs.

### 3. **Extending Ingestion Sources**

Add more URLs to the `ingestion_urls` array in the character profile to expand XBot's knowledge base.

"ingestion_urls": [
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning",
    // Add more URLs as needed
]
```

**Note:** Ensure that the added URLs contain relevant and reputable information to maintain the quality of responses.

### 4. **Customizing Response Formats**

Define how XBot structures its responses, including the use of emojis, hashtags, and mentions.

```json
"response_format": {
    "length": "up to 280 characters",
    "language": "English",
    "structure": "Complete sentences with proper grammar and punctuation.",
    "use_emojis": true,
    "include_hashtags": true,
    "include_mentions": false
}
```

- **use_emojis:** Set to `true` to include emojis at the beginning of responses.
- **include_hashtags:** Set to `true` to append relevant hashtags based on preferred topics.
- **include_mentions:** Set to `false` to exclude user mentions unless necessary.

### 5. **Implementing Additional Interaction Policies**

Define how XBot handles errors and logging.

```json
"interaction_policies": {
    "rate_limit_per_minute": 60,
    "error_handling_strategy": "retry_with_exponential_backoff",
    "logging_level": "INFO"
}
```

- **error_handling_strategy:** Options include `retry_with_exponential_backoff`, `fail_gracefully`, etc., to dictate how the bot reacts to errors.
- **logging_level:** Set the desired verbosity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).
